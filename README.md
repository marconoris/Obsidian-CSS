I'm not a developer, surely the code found here is not very horthodox. Welcome improvements!


## Reader view for Obsidian Publish 

This script activates a "reading view" on an Obsidian Publish website. This view can be useful to visualize poetic texts or to browse through images as a portfolio or simply to have a clearer view while reading. Now you can activate the "reading view" in 4 different ways:

- Using a button.
- Pressing the “r” key.
- By defining the reader-view class in the cssClass property in the frontmatter.
- Adding ?reader=true to the url of the page.

## Social box

An elegant HTML social box. I have generated and embedded the svg icons. I have put the services that I use, so you may have to adapt the code with extra icons.


## Search hotkey

A small Javascript that creates a hotkey to select the search input of an Osbidian Publish website through the keyboard.
