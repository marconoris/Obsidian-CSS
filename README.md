I'm not a developer, surely the code found here is not very horthodox. Welcome improvements!


## Toggle Obsidian Publish sidebars

I'm playing with the idea of a light and minimal version of Obsidian Publish focused on reading, hiding the sidebars. Not being a programmer, I have tried to create Javascript through chatGPT (sorry for this!). This is the result, it works quite well.


## Social box

An elegant HTML social box. I have generated and embedded the svg icons. I have put the services that I use, so you may have to adapt the code with extra icons.


## Search hotkey

A small Javascript that creates a hotkey to select the search input of an Osbidian Publish website through the keyboard.
